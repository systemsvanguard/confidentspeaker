# Exorcizing Glossophobia: Some Tips to Help

Do you remember learning to walk? Probably not, yet it is a learned skill that is not inate to us. Once learned & mastered, it benefits us for a lifetime. Do you remember learning how to ride a bicycle? Or learning how to swim? As a child, my pals on the street conned me into sitting on a bicycle ... supposedly to pose for a "cool photo" ... and I was obvivious to the fact they had placed the bicycle too conveniently on a road atop a hill. As I photo posed, they pushed the bicycle down the hill & released it with hapless me aboard .. supposedly this was their "cruel to be kind" way of teaching me to ride a bicycle.

Well, I learned quite well :

1. Never to trust those boys again ... ever!!
2. Voluntarily crashing into a thick lawn hedge, is much preferred than crashing into the neighborhood garbage truck,
3. How to quickly, and from a distance identify which hedge has thorns, and which do not,
4. For 4 milliseconds what Superman presumably feels like while while soaring through the sky at near super-sonic speed.

A decade later with the proceeds from my first paycheck, I registered myself into a local YMCA Bicycle Riding course .. and finally learned properly how to ride a bicycle. Weather permitting, I ride near weekly now.

## A Few Skills Go a Long Way

That experience taught me to (1) have a **PLAN** on how to learn something, and (2) **HOW** to seek out competent potential trainers. I now easily identify, and steer clear of the legion "self proclaimed experts" and idiots. I trust the tips below will guide you sans drama and without pain, on the path to overcoming your fear of Public Speaking.

## Glossophobia Defined

"Glossophobia" is **an irrational fear of public speaking**, or presenting and/or speaking before others. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossophobia) & [Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/glossophobia) Turns out ... a **LOT** of people ... the **vast majority** of people, share this unfounded dread of public speaking. Here now are some tips to hekp rid yourself of this plague!

## Tips to Defeat a Fear of Public Speaking

### 1. Fear is the Enemy .. Seek to Understand Your Fear

- Find the Source of Your Fear : Is it fear of looking like a fool, fear of judgment **_(by others AND yourself)_**, fear of making a mistake, .. or something else? Knowing what scares you can help you address it more directly.
- Normalize the Fear, Neatralize the Fear: Even the most experienced speakers regularly suffer from "nerves". Famous popular orator and former Prime Minister of Jamaica Michael Manley would alledgedly be so nervous prior to speeches that he often vomit! Understand that **fear is a natural response** can diminish its power over you.

### 2. Prepare Thoroughly

- **"Practice makes perfect!"** my GrandMother would say repeatedly. I found actually, "practice" more importantly, made me confident. Know your material: The more familiar you are with what you're going to say, the more confident you'll feel.
- Practice, practice, practice: Rehearse your speech multiple times. If possible, do it in the space where you'll be speaking or in front of a friend or camera. Or do a Zoom recording of yourself, and analyze it after.

### 3. Start Small

Build up gradually: Begin with small groups in a safe environment. Toastmasters clubs are perfect for this, providing a supportive atmosphere to practice and receive constructive feedback.

### 4. Visualize Success

Positive visualization: Imagine yourself giving a successful speech. Picture the audience's positive reactions and the feeling of satisfaction you'll have afterwards. Picture yourself as a winner.

### 5. Learn Relaxation Techniques

- Breathing exercises: Deep, slow breaths can help reduce stress and improve focus.
- Progressive muscle relaxation: Tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups can reduce physical anxiety symptoms.

### 6. Embrace Vulnerability

- Be authentic: Showing your true self helps build a genuine connection with the audience. Mistakes and imperfections can actually enhance this connection.

- Admit nervousness if it feels right: Sometimes, sharing with your audience that you're a bit nervous can alleviate the pressure and garner their support.

### 7. Engage With Your Audience

- Make "Eye Contact": Making eye contact with different people in the audience can create a personal connection and make the experience more conversational. IF like me, you are wary of unnecessarily making eye contact, then "fake it" ... as you scan your audience, look at indicvidual members for a few seconds apiece BUT instead of looking them direct in the eye, look at the skin an inch above the imaginary line between their two eyes. To the audience members, it appears you are making eye contact with everyone.

- Ask questions or invite participation: This can shift the dynamic and make the experience more interactive and less daunting for you.

### 8. Feedback Loop

- Seek constructive criticism: After your speech, ask for feedback. Focus on what went well and areas for improvement. IF you feel nervous regarding this, then start by asking close friends first. This by definition introduces another tatic .. if possible, "stock the audience" in advance with a few of your friends!; this also makes eye contact with audience members significantly easier.

- Reflect on your experience: Consider what you learned from the experience and how you can apply it next time.

### 9. Watch and Learn

Observe others: Watch experienced speakers or TED Talks to learn different techniques and styles.

### 10 Find Your Tribe!

- Find a mentor who can provide guidance, support, and constructive feedback in a friendly tone. Toastmasters is very good for this.

### 11. Focus on Your Message, Not on Yourself

Shift focus: Concentrate on the importance of your message and the value it provides to the audience. This shift in perspective can reduce self-consciousness.

### 12. Stay Positive

- Affirmations: Use positive affirmations to boost your confidence before going on stage.

- Building on the above ... go make, buy, borrow, rent, or steal some Positivity Mantras ... and turn their volume on full blast whenever you feel "the blues" approaching.

- Never allow Negativity / negative thoughts to **live rent free in your head**. Evict the sour Ingrates, and rent the space out instead to positive proclamations.

- Celebrate small victories: Acknowledge your progress, no matter how small. AND , record these "victories" in a Success Journal. In the future when you feel nervous, remind yourself of the many times "Chewed Gum & Kicked Butt" / prior wins, by consulting said Journal.

## Go Forth & Speak!

I do hope these tips will be as helpful to you, as they werte to me.
