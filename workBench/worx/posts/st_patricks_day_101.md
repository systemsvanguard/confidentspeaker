# Happy St Patrick's Day Everyone

### A Little Generosity Goes a Long Way!

St Paddy's Day is often associated with multi-culturalism, imbibing, luck, & the best of Irish culture. For the curious among us, that may wonder WHY the day is so often associated with drinking AND celebrated world-wide? ... well, the high form of the story is St Paddy did like himself the occasional drink, AND wanted to encourage generosity! ðŸ˜Š

An overly thrifty Inn-Keeper pouring Patrick's beer shortchanged him & did not fill the mug!!

St Paddy may have inadvertently _(or purposely)_ ðŸ˜‰ led said dude to believe that his frugality/ stinginess was due to his massive beer stores in the cellar being haunted ðŸ˜± ... AND ... <strong>this dilemma could only be reversed by being more generous overall</strong>. After such proselytizing, Sir BarKeep decided to fill everyone's mug to the brim free, & then some. ðŸ™‚

Moral of the Story: <strong>Be more generous</strong>.
