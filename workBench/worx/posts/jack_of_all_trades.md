# Jack of All Trades - Is That a Bad Thing?

Being an **_IT Specialist_** ðŸ¤“ for many years, I have long lived in dread of a popular quote & motto/ watchword of mine; **"Jack of ALL trades, and Master of None!"**

Horrors of horrors! ðŸ˜¨ No professional wants that tag-line directed at them. A painful quote for me, as I am a curious soul, a natural "dabbler", and a tech dilettante. I have struggled to reconcile the concepts of specialization, "narrow focus", deliberate mastery, and the "**10,000 Hour Rule**", with these other 2 quotes I love :

1. "If youâ€™re the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room." ~ Unknown
2. "It is hard to fill a cup that is already full" ~ Mo'at - Avatar (2009)

Re the infamous **_"master of none"_** quote, in October 2022 a good friend of mine, Liban G. educated & liberated me that I only had 1/2 the quote! ðŸ˜² ... and that the quote was initially a compliment with the opposite meaning of how it's interpreted now. Here is the full quote:

<div class="content">
  <blockquote class="has-background-light">
    <p>A <strong><em>Jack of All Trades</em></strong> is a master of none, ... <strong>but</strong> oftentimes better than a master of one." - <span><em>Robert Greene about future playwright & poet, <strong>William Shakespeare</strong></em> </span>  </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>

Yes ... <strong>THE</strong> William Shakespeare!

It's worth remembering that the original definition of **_"amateur"_** is someone that does something primarily for the love of the thing.
