	<h1>Happy St Patrick's Day Everyone</h1>
	
	<p>St Paddy's Day is often associated with multi-culturalism, imbibing, luck, &amp; the best of Irish culture. For the curious among us, that may wonder WHY the day is so often associated with drinking AND celebrated world-wide? ... well, the high form of the story is St Paddy did like himself the occasional drink, AND wanted to encourage generosity! ðŸ˜Š</p>
<p>An overly thrifty Inn-Keeper pouring Patrick's beer shortchanged him &amp; did not fill the mug!!</p>
<p>St Paddy may have inadvertently <em>(or purposely)</em> ðŸ˜‰ led said dude to believe that his frugality/ stinginess was due to his massive beer stores in the cellar being haunted ðŸ˜± ... AND ... <strong>this dilemma could only be reversed by being more generous overall</strong>. After such proselytizing, Sir BarKeep decided to fill everyone's mug to the brim free, &amp; then some. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Moral of the Story: <strong>Be more generous</strong>.</p>
